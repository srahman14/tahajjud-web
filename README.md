# Tahajjud-Web
- An interactive website with sole purpose to calculate and return Tahajjud timings

## How this site calculates the time of Tahajjud (specifically the last third of the night?
- This site uses the Aladhan API to get the time of Maghrib and Fajr (using method of Umm al-Qura) for London only. 
- Thereafter, the time from Maghrib till Fajr is calculated and divided into three thirds, and simply we subtract the time from Fajr by one-third of the difference to find out the starting point of the last third of the night.
