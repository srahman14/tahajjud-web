          What is prescribed with regard to prayers at night is that the prayers should be offered <span className='bg-yellow-200 p-1 font-bold'>two rak‘ahs by two, then the worshipper should end his prayers with one rak‘ah</span>, so as to make the prayers odd-numbered.
          <span className='block'><span className='font-bold'>Ibn ‘Umar</span> narrated that a man asked <span className='font-bold'>the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)</span> about the prayers offered at night. <span className='font-bold'>the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)</span> said:</span>
          <span className='block font-bold p-2 mt-2 mb-2 bg-yellow-200'>“The night prayers are two by two, then if one of you fears that dawn may come, he should pray one rak‘ah, which will make what he has prayed odd-numbered.”</span>
